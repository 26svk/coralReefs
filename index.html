    <td>Joonwoo has found that ocean acidity has a significant effect on coral reefs. In his research, he decided to look into the effect of ocean acidification on the population of the Staghorn coral. He found that as the ocean pH level decreased, the population of Staghorn coral decreased. On a pH scale, a lower number indicates the object is more acidic. Ocean acidification was mainly caused by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As the ocean waters absorbed the carbon dioxide, its acidity decreased and this led to the decrease of carbonate ions. Carbonate ions are crucial for Staghorn coral, as they form their skeletons with the help of carbonate ions. Since Staghorn coral provides shelter for various marine life and is an important component of the coral reef, a decrease in the Staghorn coral population would lead to imbalances and disruptions in the coral reef ecosystem. </td>
    <td>Saksham has found that agriculture greatly affects coral reefs. In his research, he specifically looked into how the agricultural covering percentage affected the population of the Hawksbill population. One way agriculture affects the Hawksbill population is Eutrophication, which is the over-enrichment of the ocean due to the use of fertilizers in coastal soil can cause health risks to turtles such as tumors and brain defects in offspring. Another way agriculture affects the Hawksbill population is effluent. Effluents are sewage or disposal sedimentation and water that is put into the ocean and can cause a great risk to marine biotic health. From his experiment, Saksham concluded that had a significant influence on the Hawkbill population, as when the agricultural coverage percentage increased, the Hawksbill population decreased. A decrease in the Hawksbill populations could cause disruptions in the coral reef ecosystem and cause it to collapse.</td>

    <td>Some could suggest decreasing carbon emissions. However, the majority of carbon emissions around the world are caused by the burning of fossil fuels and pollution from transportation. Directly decreasing this would be time-consuming, as this would require cooperation with governments and companies. Instead, the solution to ocean acidification is the introduction of a type of algae called diatems. Diatems can absorb up to 10-20 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. This is the equivalent of the amount of carbon dioxide the rainforests around the world collect each year. Through this, the ocean waters will become less acidic and help to return the population of the Staghorn coral to its original state.</td>
    <td>One way we can help improve coastal agriculture is by expanding crop rotations. This can reduce the amount of land we use for agriculture, and therefore reduce the chances of land being used near coastal areas. As we know from our correlation, this would mean a less harsh effect on the Hawksbill Sea Turtle population and perhaps many other species living in the coral reefs.</td>
